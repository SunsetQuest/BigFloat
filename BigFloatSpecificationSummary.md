# BigFloat Specification

The `BigFloat` struct is a sophisticated implementation of an arbitrary-precision floating-point number in C#, designed to provide high-precision arithmetic with virtually unlimited precision, limited only by available memory. It leverages the `System.Numerics.BigInteger` type for its mantissa, ensuring robust handling of large numbers, and incorporates a base-2 exponent system for flexible scaling. This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the `BigFloat` type, detailing its structure, properties, methods, operators, type conversions, and additional features such as mathematical constants and utility functions. Below, we expand on the core concepts, combining the best elements from the provided summaries to create a detailed and authoritative reference.

## Core Concept

`BigFloat` is a **readonly partial struct** that represents a floating-point number with arbitrary precision. Unlike traditional floating-point types like `float` or `double`, which are constrained by fixed bit widths (e.g., 32 or 64 bits), `BigFloat` uses a `BigInteger` for its mantissa (`DataBits`) and an integer (`Scale`) for its base-2 exponent. This design allows it to handle numbers of any size and precision, making it ideal for applications requiring exact arithmetic, such as scientific computing, cryptography, or financial calculations.

A key feature of `BigFloat` is its use of **extra guard bits** (defined as a constant `GuardBits`, typically 32), which are included in the `DataBits` to enhance precision and control rounding during operations. These guard bits act as a buffer, ensuring that arithmetic results remain accurate even when precision is adjusted or numbers are converted.

---

## Core Structure

The `BigFloat` struct is defined as follows in C#:

```csharp
public readonly partial struct BigFloat
{
    public const int GuardBits = 32;
    public readonly BigInteger DataBits { get; }
    internal readonly int _size;
    public readonly int Scale { get; init; }
}
```

### Key Internal State

- **`DataBits` (readonly BigInteger)**:
  - The mantissa of the number, storing the significant digits in a `BigInteger`.
  - Includes `GuardBits` to provide additional precision beyond the visible significant bits.
  - Can be positive, negative, or zero, with the sign preserved in the `BigInteger`.

- **`Scale` (readonly int)**:
  - The base-2 exponent offset, determining the position of the radix point (binary point).
  - A positive `Scale` shifts the radix point to the right, effectively multiplying the value by \(2^{\text{Scale}}\).
  - A negative `Scale` shifts the radix point to the left, dividing by \(2^{|\text{Scale}|}\).
  - When `Scale` is zero, the radix point is positioned immediately after the main bits but before the guard bits.

- **`_size` (internal readonly int)**:
  - Represents the bit length of the absolute value of `DataBits`, including the guard bits.
  - Equals zero only if `DataBits` is exactly zero.
  - Used internally to track the total size of the number in bits.

## Core Properties

The `BigFloat` struct exposes a rich set of properties to describe its state and behavior:

- **`Size` (int)**:
  - The precision of the number in bits, excluding the `GuardBits`.
  - Calculated as `Math.Max(0, _size - GuardBits)`.
  - Represents the number of significant bits available for computation after accounting for the guard bits.

- **`BinaryExponent` (int)**:
  - The overall base-2 exponent of the number.
  - Computed as `Scale + _size - GuardBits - 1`.
  - Indicates the effective exponent when considering both the scale and the bit length.

- **`IsZero` (bool)**:
  - Returns `true` if the value is effectively zero, taking into account precision and scale.
  - Considers rounding effects from guard bits.

- **`IsStrictZero` (bool)**:
  - Returns `true` only if `DataBits` is exactly zero (no rounding considered).

- **`IsOutOfPrecision` (bool)**:
  - Returns `true` if the number has less than one bit of precision (`_size < GuardBits`).
  - Indicates that the numberâ€™s significant bits are entirely within the guard bits range.

- **`IsPositive` / `IsNegative` (bool)**:
  - Determines the sign of the number based on the `Sign` property after rounding.

- **`Sign` (int)**:
  - Returns `-1` (negative), `0` (zero), or `1` (positive).
  - For numbers with insufficient precision, rounds based on the most significant guard bit.

- **`UnscaledValue` (BigInteger)**:
  - The integer value of the number after removing and rounding the `GuardBits`.
  - Represents the mantissa as it would appear without the scale applied.

- **`SizeWithGuardBits` (int)**:
  - An alias for `_size`, representing the total bit length of `DataBits`, including guard bits.

- **`Precision` (int)**:
  - The precision in bits, excluding guard bits (`_size - GuardBits`).
  - Can be negative if `_size` is less than `GuardBits`.

- **`Accuracy` (int)**:
  - The negative of the scale (`-Scale`).
  - Represents the number of bits to the right of the radix point.

- **`IsInteger` (bool)**:
  - Returns `true` if the fractional part is effectively zero or rounds to an integer.
  - Considers up to half of the guard bits for rounding purposes.

### Bit Extraction Properties

- **`Lowest64BitsWithGuardBits` (ulong)**:
  - The least significant 64 bits of `DataBits`, including hidden guard bits.

- **`Lowest64Bits` (ulong)**:
  - The least significant 64 bits after rounding and removing guard bits.

- **`Highest64Bits` (ulong)**:
  - The most significant 64 bits of the magnitude of `DataBits`.

- **`Highest128Bits` (UInt128)**:
  - The most significant 128 bits of the magnitude of `DataBits`.

## Static Properties

`BigFloat` provides predefined instances for common values:

- **`Zero` (BigFloat)**:
  - Represents the value 0 with zero size, precision, scale, and accuracy.

- **`One` (BigFloat)**:
  - Represents the value 1 with minimal precision plus `GuardBits`.

- **`NegativeOne` (BigFloat)**:
  - Represents the value -1 with minimal precision plus `GuardBits`.
